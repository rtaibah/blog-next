title: Reassembling My Bike in Jeddah
---

After serving me faithfully in my daily commute to and fro Cal's Campus (8 miles both ways.) I just got around reassembling it in Jeddah today. Learned so much about how bikes work.<br>Jeddah isn't really known for being bike friendly, but I hope I muster the courage to ride around town. Sort of like my new extreme sport hobby.
