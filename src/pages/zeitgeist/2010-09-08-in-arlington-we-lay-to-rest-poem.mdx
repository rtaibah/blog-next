!['In Arlington We Lay To Rest [POEM]'](/assets/images/content/zeitgeist/in-arlington-we-lay-to-rest.jpg)

<div style={{textAlign:"center",margin:"5px 0",padding:0}}>

In Arlington we lay to rest

our bravest and our very best.

We send our children off to war

defending what we soon ignore.

_

"You're free to worship," so we say.

"But if you're muslim, go away."

Is this what they were dying for:

Intolerance, and nothing more?

_

Must one be christian to obtain

the liberties that we proclaim?

These soldiers died for liberty.

They didn't die for bigotry.

_

So look upon this hallowed field,

not only crosses are revealed.

For you'll see stars and crescents too.

They also sacrificed for you.

_

In Arlington we lay to rest

our bravest and our very best.

They knew what they were dying for.

It's something that we can't ignore.
