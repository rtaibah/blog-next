Johanna Blakely had a very interesting presentation at TED about intellectual property in the fashion industry (or lack thereof.) One slide stood out:

So the question is, when will the media industry get the hint & stop punishing us as consumers?
  
Oh btw, here is the [presentation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL2FOrx41N0#), it is really interesting. Watch it!
