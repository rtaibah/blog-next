excerpt: "In Saudi, it is traditional for some tribesmen to rub their noses. This is considered a very noble thing, and not in any way homosexual. The tradition comes off as weird and awkward to many 'modern' Saudis. Uturn (a popular Saudi Youtube channel) decided to parody the original first kiss video with a 'first nose' video."

The tradition comes off as weird and awkward to many 'modern' Saudis. Uturn (a popular Saudi Youtube channel) decided to parody the original first [kiss video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpbDHxCV29A) with a 'first nose' video.
