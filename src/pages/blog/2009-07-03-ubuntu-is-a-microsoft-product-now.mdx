---

Well at least according to Dell's website. A 1.6GHz Atom CPU, 8GB of disk space armed with Microsoft's latest masterpiece: Ubuntu!

**Update:** Here is [the original Dell website](http://www1.euro.dell.com/uk/en/home/mini_laptop_deals/fs.aspx?refid=mini_laptop_deals&s=dhs&cs=ukdhs1). The error is still up. Not fixed. Doesn't matter, print screen already did the damage. ;)

**Update 2**: After 5 days from the original post, Dell finally fixed it.
