While surfing the tubes, I stumbled onto this picture. Apparently some dude tried to scan his Ubuntu using the [xponlinescanner](http://xponlinescanner.com/) utility. Lo and behold, some 3 XP viruses pwned his Ubuntu (what a shame). He better watch out and resolve the Spyware.IEMonstor.b virus, it's critical! Ya right, LOLZ!
